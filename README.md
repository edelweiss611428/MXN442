# Multitask Zero-Variance Control Variates via L2,1-Norm Regularisation

Constructing Zero-Variance Control Variates following the schemes in Mira et al. (2013), South et al. (2023) is equivalent to solving a linear regression problem, which easily becomes over-parameterised in high-dimensional applications. Penalised regression techniques such as LASSO and ridge regression can be used to estimate the regression coefficients. Often, there are more than one (T) expectation term to be estimated, and these tasks might be related. However, the previously mentioned ZVCV methods solve the T regression problems separately (i.e., in a single-task fashion). We have proposed a multitask regularised ZVCV framework based on â„“2,1-norm regularisation, which may help capture the task relatedness by enforcing group sparcity. It implicitly assumes that the T tasks are related, which  may not be true. We expect that the statistical efficiency of the single-task regularised ZVCV methods will be improved in a multi-task learning framework.
